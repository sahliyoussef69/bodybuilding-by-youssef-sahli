    <h1>BodyBuilding</h1>
    <p>Bodybuilding is the practice of progressive resistance exercise to build, control, and develop one's muscles via hypertrophy.</p>
    <p>An individual who engages in this activity is referred to as a bodybuilder. It is primarily undertaken for aesthetic purposes over <br> 
    functional ones, distinguishing it from similar activities such as powerlifting, which focuses solely on increasing <br> the physical load one can exert.</p>

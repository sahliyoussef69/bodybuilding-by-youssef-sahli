BodyBuilding
Bodybuilding is the practice of progressive resistance exercise to build, control, and develop one's muscles via hypertrophy.

An individual who engages in this activity is referred to as a bodybuilder. It is primarily undertaken for aesthetic purposes over
functional ones, distinguishing it from similar activities such as powerlifting, which focuses solely on increasing
the physical load one can exert.
